# UnsatisfactoryScriptsForBeatSaberFromBlender

Collection of scripts that I use to make Modcharts.

These are not intended for public release, therefore they are mostly un-documented, and
most likely very user-unfriendly.

These scripts were used to create:
* [Made Me This Way](https://beatsaver.com/maps/206c7)
* [Bad Manners](https://beatsaver.com/maps/21bf4)
